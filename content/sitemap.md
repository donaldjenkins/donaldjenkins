<div id="htmlmap_posts">Culture [](#htmlmap_cats)
-------------------------

**My interests span contemporary art, which has surrounded me ever since my infancy, [heraldry](https://cdn.donaldjenkins.com/documents/jenkins-arms-large.jpg?lossy=1&w=2560&ssl=1 "The Jenkins arms are blazoned Azure, two Chevronels each curving outwards and chief wards at the apex and there expanding into a point flory Gold. And for the crest upon a helm with a wreath Or and Azure A horse's head affronty coupled at the neck Azure and jest de lis Gold"), music, especially from Mozart up to the mid-Romantic period, as well as well-sung English choral music from the sixteenth, seventeenth and nineteenth centuries. I have worked in the field of culture and media in various capacities.**

Literature [](#htmlmap_cats)
----------------------------

**My favourite authors are those who wrote after the turn of the nineteenth century, but before the death of Camus, which still leaves quite a wide range. This happens to coincide with the so-called période grammaticale, a period during which form was deemed to matter more than substance, not because substance did not matter, but because form was the surest way of gauging the true value of the substance behind it—a view with which I heartily agree.**

Politics [](#htmlmap_cats)
--------------------------

**Politics are hardly a side interest, as can be seen from the articles collected here. I first indulged my taste for [politics](/politics/) and current affairs at Oxford at the [Oxford Union Society](http://www.oxford-union.org/ "More on Oxford Union Society"), and then as a student in Paris, where I was President of [Conférence Olivaint](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conf%C3%A9rence_Olivaint "Conférence Olivaint is the oldest of the French student societies, established in 1875").**

Religion [](#htmlmap_cats)
--------------------------

**Like the first Queen Elizabeth, I firmly believe in not putting windows into men’s souls (Collinson, Patrick (2004). Elizabeth I. Oxford Dictionary of National Biography). Yet like the second Queen of the same name, I take my religion (relatively) seriously and have occasionally shared thoughts about the subject here.**

Sundry [](#htmlmap_cats)
