Other more personal issues intervened and kept me away from the blog, which doesn’t mean I didn’t keep busy on other fronts. Of course, it’s always possible to keep track of me on Twitter or, if I actually know you in real life, on Facebook. I spent a lot of the time in 2008 travelling. I worked in South Africa initially, which was interesting. I then spent a fair amount of time criss-crossing the Atlantic, which work had not left time to do in recent years, and rediscovering my Anglospheric roots. I will try to post regularly to this site now that things (some things anyway) have settled a bit.'

 I am sorry I wrote nothing at all in the fourth quarter of 2008. I was planning to write, among other topics, about Iran, South Africa, the French Constitution, *Summorum Pontificum*, and the American presidential election. None of this has yet materialised because, annoyingly, other more personal issues intervened and kept me away from the blog, which doesn’t mean I didn’t keep busy on other fronts. Of course, I’m a pretty efficient web 2.0 user, so it’s always possible to keep track of me when I’m not in a mood to post here: on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/donaldjenkins), where I post daily, [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/astorg/), or, if I actually know you in real life, on [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=706186626&ref=profile) and even keeping track of [what I enjoyed reading on the web](http://www.google.com/reader/shared/08163851508448927619).

I spent a lot of the time in 2008 travelling. I worked in South Africa initially, which was interesting. Because I find France a rather tiresome place to live in nowadays, I then spent a fair amount of time criss-crossing the Atlantic, which work had not left time to do in recent years, and rediscovering my Anglospheric roots. I was given a surprise Christmas which was the best I have had since my last family Christmas five years ago. My [trip to Palermo](http://www.flickr.com/photos/astorg/sets/72157611827706345/) from which I have just returned let me end a pretty dull year on a high note.

Taking recent trends to their logical conclusion, I have also rescinded my decision, taken when I moved to Paris, to read only French authors who started writing before the death of Camus whom I regard as France’s last truly great writer. While this extreme resolution was necessary at the time, because I felt I had not read enough in French and believed that most modern French authors were mediocre, illiterate poseurs, I decided a few weeks ago it was time to move on: so I will be [reading only in English](http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1461994) from now on, starting with the authors I have most been missing, namely Nancy Mitford, Evelyn Waugh, Trollope and Jane Austen.

I will try to post regularly to this site now that things—well, some things anyway—have settled a bit.
