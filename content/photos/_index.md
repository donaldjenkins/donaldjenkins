summary: "As Apple started producing increasingly seriously good cameras in their phones, I started using my [phone](https://www.flickr.com/photos/astorg/albums/72157621916056260) for the vast majority of my pictures. Many of the pictures on this page were taken with one. For serious pictures, have a look at  [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/astorg), for more frequent updates, go to  [Instagram](https://instagram.com/donaldjenkins_/). I tend to prefer working in black and white, but that isn’t by any means a systematic rule."

## [Black and white](https://www.flickr.com/photos/astorg/albums/72157622017095408 "Donald's black and white photos on Flickr")

Most of my favorite photographs—in keeping with my minimalist approach to art and to design—are black and white: these ones were shot all over the world.

[Duck collection in New York apartment](https://cdn.donaldjenkins.com/images/duck-collection-in-new-york-apartment-768x1024.jpg?lossy=1&ssl=1)
A collection of ducks owned by a New York friend

[Masai Mara National Reserve](https://cdn.donaldjenkins.com/images/masai-mara-national-reserve-1024x768.jpg?lossy=1&ssl=1)
Masai Mara National Reserve is a large game reserve in Narok County, Kenya. It is globally famous for its exceptional population of lions, leopards and cheetahs, and the annual migration of zebra, Thomson's gazelle, and wildebeest to and from the Serengeti every year from July to October, known as the Great Migration.

[Manhattan skyline from Brooklyn](https://cdn.donaldjenkins.com/images/manhattan-skyline-from-brooklyn-1024x683.jpg?lossy=1&ssl=1)
Shot with DxO ONE: this camera's main advantage is the massive sensor in a small body. As a result, the pictures are wonderful, even in low light.

[The Fountain at place du Grand Mézel in Geneva](https://cdn.donaldjenkins.com/images/the-fountain-at-place-du-grand-mezel-in-geneva-1024x1024.jpg?lossy=1&ssl=1)
This is just next door to the house where I grew up in the Old City of Geneva

[The Cloisters at New College, Oxford](https://cdn.donaldjenkins.com/images/the-cloisters-at-new-college-oxford-768x1024.jpg?lossy=1&ssl=1)
This was built around 1395-1400 in Wheatley stone. It was re-slated in 1949. The Cloister walks contain eight medieval stone figures removed from the Chapel.

[St. Stephen's Cathedral in Vienna](https://cdn.donaldjenkins.com/images/st-stephen-s-cathedral-in-vienna-1024x768.jpg?lossy=1&ssl=1)
St. Stephen's Cathedral is the mother church of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Vienna and the seat of the Archbishop of Vienna, Christoph Cardinal Schönborn, OP. The current Romanesque and Gothic form of the cathedral, seen today in the Stephansplatz, was largely initiated by Duke Rudolf IV (1339–1365) and stands on the ruins of two earlier churches, the first a parish church consecrated in 1147.

[The Burggarten in Vienna](https://cdn.donaldjenkins.com/images/the-burggarten-in-vienna-1024x768.jpg?lossy=1&ssl=1)
This garden was laid out in 1818 as a private garden of the Emperor on an area of approx. 38.000 m². It is located directly at the Ringstrasse beside the Hofburg and the Albertina.

[Statue of Hermes at the Villa Médicis](https://cdn.donaldjenkins.com/images/statue-of-hermes-at-the-villa-medicis-768x1024.jpg?lossy=1&ssl=1)

[The Cloister at Quattro santi coronati, Rome](https://cdn.donaldjenkins.com/images/the-cloister-at-quattro-santi-coronati-rome-768x1024.jpg?lossy=1&ssl=1)
This relatively unknown Roman church dates back to the fourth or fifth century, and is devoted to four anonymous saints and martyrs. It includes two courtyards, the fortified Cardinal Palace with the Saint Silvester Chapel, and the monastery, pictured here, with its cosmatesque cloister

[The statue of St. Praxedes](https://cdn.donaldjenkins.com/images/the-statue-of-st.-praxedes-768x1024.jpg?lossy=1&ssl=1)
This church was built in the honour of the Roman martyr St. Praxedes, on the alleged site of her house, to which, when it was rebuilt by Pope St. Paschal I (the present Santa Prassede), her relics were taken.

[Abandoned ship at Moynak](https://cdn.donaldjenkins.com/images/abandoned-ship-at-moynak-1024x768.jpg?lossy=1&ssl=1)
When the Aral Sea dried up, several ships were left stranded at the Sea's main port, Moynak, and have become tourist attractions;

## [Colour](https://www.flickr.com/photos/astorg/albums/with/72157622017095408 "Donald's photos on Flickr")

Sometimes colour is so intrinsically part of a scene that it makes no sense to strip it out. These are a few examples, in very different contexts, of such situations. Go to [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/astorg/albums/with/72157622017095408) to see a wider range.

[The New Building at Magdalen College](https://cdn.donaldjenkins.com/images/the-new-building-at-magdalen-college-1024x768.jpg?lossy=1&ssl=1)
In the late 1720s, Edward Butler, the then President, planned to replace most of the Cloisters with a grand new quadrangle in the Palladian style, and commissioned Edward Holdsworth to design it. Work started in 1733 on what would have been the north range of this new quadrangle, but after this range was finished by the end of the decade. the project went no further, presumably owing to a lack of energy and funding.

[Far East meets Near East](https://cdn.donaldjenkins.com/images/far-east-meets-near-east-768x1024.jpg?lossy=1&ssl=1)
Petra is believed to have been settled as early as 9,000 BC, and it was possibly established in the 4th century BC as the capital city of the Nabataean Kingdom. The Nabataeans were nomadic Arabs who invested in Petra's proximity to the trade routes by establishing it as a major regional trading hub

## [Paris](https://www.flickr.com/photos/astorg/albums/72157606848423346 "Donald's Paris photos on Flickr")

The places I have most enjoyed photographing in Paris are the [Tuileries Gardens](https://www.flickr.com/search/?user_id=40526588%40N00&sort=date-taken-desc&text=tuileries&view_all=1) and the [Pompidou Centre](https://www.flickr.com/search/?user_id=40526588%40N00&sort=date-taken-desc&text=pompidou%20centre&view_all=1) in Beaubourg.

[A baker in rue des Rosiers](https://cdn.donaldjenkins.com/images/a-baker-in-rue-des-rosiers-1024x768.jpg?lossy=1&ssl=1)

## [Israel](https://www.flickr.com/photos/astorg/albums/72157648909579281 "Donald's Israel photos on Flickr")

Having not returned to the Holy Land since having gone there with my parents at the age of three, I went again, finally, on a pilgrimage to the Holy Places in 2014—and have not looked back since. Now the land of Jesus, which happens to also be the Promised Land of the Jewish people, has become my most regular destination, effectively a second home.

## Archie and Peggy

[Burmese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burmese_cat "Find out about the Burmese breed") cats Archie, whom I adopted in December 2015, and Peggy, who joined us in July 2016, have changed my life completely for the better. They are supremely intelligent and capable of greater loyalty, and of giving more affection, than any human I have encountered, with few exceptions. They have provided the inspiration needed on the way to becoming a vegan.

[Archie at three weeks](https://cdn.donaldjenkins.com/images/archie-at-three-weeks-1024x680.jpg?lossy=1&ssl=1)
This is the picture on whose basis I dedcided to go and visit Archie's breeder

[Playing ball](https://cdn.donaldjenkins.com/images/playing-ball-1024x1024.jpg?lossy=1&ssl=1)
Cats are passionate hunters, and rubber balls provide an excellent substitute for the prey they are unlikely to meet in a central city flat.

[Wise beyond his years](https://cdn.donaldjenkins.com/images/wise-beyond-his-years.jpg?lossy=1&resize=720%2C960&ssl=1)
At just nine months old, little Archie looks wise well beyond his years.

Cats spend about sixteen hours a day sleeping

[Morning affection](https://cdn.donaldjenkins.com/images/morning-affection-1024x768.jpg?lossy=1&ssl=1)
The loyalty and afection shown by pets beats that of any human.

## And finally…

These were taken at various stages in my life in Geneva, Tel-Aviv, Jerusalem, Oxford, Paris, and New York.
