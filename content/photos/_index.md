As Apple started producing increasingly seriously good cameras in their phones, I began using my [phone](https://www.flickr.com/photos/astorg/albums/72157621916056260) for the vast majority of my pictures. Many of the photographs on this page were taken with one. For serious pictures, have a look at [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/astorg); for more frequent updates, go to [Instagram](https://instagram.com/donaldjenkins_/). I tend to prefer working in black and white, but that isnâ€™t by any means a systematic rule.
