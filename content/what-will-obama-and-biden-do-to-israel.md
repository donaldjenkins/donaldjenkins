excerpt: "> …During that committee hearing, at the height of the Lebanon War, Sen. John \\[sic\\] Biden (Delaware) had attacked Israeli settlements in Judea and Samaria and threatened that if Israel did not immediately cease this activity, the US would have to cut economic aid to Israel. When the senator raised his voice and banged twice on the table with his fist, Begin commented to him: “This desk is designed for writing, not for fists. Don’t threaten us with slashing aid. Do you think that because the US lends us money it is entitled to impose on us what we must do? We are grateful for the assistance we have received, but we are not to be threatened. I am a proud Jew. Three thousand years of culture are behind me, and you will not frighten me with threats. Take note: we do not want a single soldier of yours to die for us. After the meeting, Sen. Moynihan approached Begin and praised him for his cutting reply. To which Begin answered with thanks, defining his stand against threats.\n\nJerusalem Post, 1992, \\[via\\] [I like your style](http://ilikeyourstyle.net/2008/08/29/de-quoi-obama-biden-est-il-le-nom/ \"I like your style website\")"
