We celebrate today the sixtieth anniversary of Her Majesty The Queen’s accession. Those of my fellow citizens who, like I, throughout the Commonwealth, have had the privilege of being her subjects for our entire lives must often — out of habit and, perhaps, a very English need for understatement in all things, especially the more important ones — have taken our Sovereign for granted. Yet I think it appropriate today to reflect on what we owe Her Majesty as a nation, as does the vibrant community of countries whose unity she has symbolised for all these years.

Her Majesty has never let us down, even in the most trying of situations. Indeed on countless occasions — including last year on her state visit to Ireland — she has found the words to express what was right and honourable for us as a nation, without regard for her own personal circumstances.

I am certain all will wish to join me in paying tribute to our beloved Sovereign in the prayer composed, with Her Majesty’s participation, and [published](https://www.donaldjenkins.com/documents/diamond-jubilee-liturgical-resources.pdf) by the Church of England on the occasion of the sixtieth anniversary of her accession:

> God of time and eternity,  
>  whose Son reigns as servant, not master;  
>  we give you thanks and praise  
>  that you have blessed this Nation, the Realms and Territories with Elizabeth  
>  our beloved and glorious Queen.  
>  In this year of Jubilee,  
>  grant her your gifts of love and joy and peace  
>  as she continues in faithful obedience to you, her Lord and God and in devoted service to her lands and peoples,  
>  and those of the Commonwealth,  
>  now and all the days of her life;  
>  through Jesus Christ our Lord.  
>  Amen.
