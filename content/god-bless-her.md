excerpt: 'I have always rejoiced in my loyalty to the Sovereign. In fifty-years of service to her peoples, Her Majesty has never once failed to exemplify with dignity, simplicity and good humour all that is best in our institutions and traditions. She is owed, by birthright, our unswerving loyalty, but she has deserved yet more than that: our deepest affection.'
