It looks like I was the first person to have activated a newly-acquired [ iPhone 3G S](http://www.apple.com/iphone/ "Apple - iPhone - Mobile phone, iPod, and Internet device."). The people at [Orange](http://www.orange.fr/ "Portail Orange") called me yesterday to ask whether I wanted to collect mine at midnight, as they were opening their [Champs-Elysées store](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=orange+champs-elys%C3%A9es,+paris&vps=1&jsv=163d&sll=33.967357,-118.097184&sspn=0.622999,1.234589&num=10&iwloc=A&iwstate1=saveplace) specially for the occasion, making them the first retail outlet in the world to sell the new phones as Paris is six hours ahead of Standard Eastern Time.

Because I’ve been using the iPhone from day one, the Orange team had arranged for me to be the first to collect a brand-new [32GB iPhone 3G S](http://www.apple.com/iphone/iphone-3g-s/ "Apple - iPhone - View all the features of the new iPhone 3G S.") and they immediately activated it for me in-store. This was my third phone in under two years:

<div class="outer-container"><div class="centering-container"><div class="inner-container"><div class="caption-box" style="width: 500px"><div> ![lThree generations of iPhones](http://cloud.donaldjenkins.com/images/blog-posts/iphone-3gs-1.jpg "I have owned all three generations of iPhones") </div><div class="caption-text"> Three generations of iPhones </div></div></div></div></div>Although registration of the phone in iTunes doesn’t run very smoothly when you get back home (I kept getting the message to “Register and set up your iTunes store account”), an issue I had already experienced with the 3G version, I decided to leave this till later and have been happily testing the phone since this morning.

The main improvements in the hardware are the much better speed (the lag you experienced with memory-intensive applications such as email and Contacts has vanished) and a much better camera. Although the improvement is only one megapixel the difference in photo quality is palpable.

Changes to the software (which of course you can use with your previous-generation phones) are more numerous. I’m particularly delighted with the new cut/paste function, which is incredibly easy to use:

<div class="outer-container"><div class="centering-container"><div class="inner-container"><div class="caption-box" style="width: 320px"><div> ![lCut and paste on the iPhone 3GS](http://cloud.donaldjenkins.com/images/blog-posts/iphone-3gs-3.jpg "Cut and paste is at last available on the iPhone 3GS and it works beautifully") </div><div class="caption-text"> Cut and paste is at last available on the iPhone 3GS </div></div></div></div></div>Tethering and MMS are working on the Orange France network from day one. While I haven’t tested tethering yet, I like being able to send MMS, a feature not yet available in the US (in unlimited quantities, too, as my French plan has no cap on data, MMS or SMS):

<div class="outer-container"><div class="centering-container"><div class="inner-container"><div class="caption-box" style="width: 320px"><div> ![lMMS on the iPhone](http://cloud.donaldjenkins.com/images/blog-posts/iphone-3gs-4.jpg "MMS on the iPhone with Orange France, from day one") </div><div class="caption-text"> MMS on the iPhone with Orange France, from day one </div></div></div></div></div>So far, few applications have been updated to reflect the new OS 3.0 [improvements](http://www.apple.com/iphone/softwareupdate/ "Apple - iPhone - New features in the iPhone 3.0 Software Update."), so I’m still sticking with those I was using before: [CameraKit](http://sites.google.com/site/cbtdev/camerakit "About CameraKit ‎(CBTDEV)‎") (which replaces the iPhone Camera software and does much, much more; probably the most impressive iPhone application I’ve seen), [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/apps/application.php?id=6628568379 "Incompatible Browser | Facebook"), [Pingle](http://curioussquid.com/home/pingle/ "Pingle «  Curious Squid"), [Evernote](http://www.evernote.com/ "Remember Everything. | Evernote Corporation"), [Remember The Milk](http://www.rememberthemilk.com/ "Remember The Milk: Online to do list and task management"), [BodyBook Fitness Book](http://www.backpocketsoftware.com/ "Back Pocket Software - Back Pocket Software"), [12C Platinum](http://www.rlmtools.com/iPhone/12CP/Detail.html "iPhone 12C Platinum Main Page") and [Byline](http://www.phantomfish.com/bylinehelp.html "Phantom Fish - Byline - Help").

<div class="outer-container"><div class="centering-container"><div class="inner-container"><div class="caption-box" style="width: 320px"><div> ![lMy iPhone home screen with the main applications I use](http://cloud.donaldjenkins.com/images/blog-posts/iphone-3gs-2.jpg "My iPhone home screen with the main applications I use") </div><div class="caption-text"> My iPhone home screen with the main applications I use </div></div></div></div></div>But my favourite feature by far is the appearance of video. A quick test this morning I found very satisfactory. I like being able to upload videos directly to MobileMe or YouTube, although I wish Vimeo were available as well:

<div class="outer-container"><div class="centering-container"><div class="inner-container"><div class="caption-box" style="width: 500px"><div> <iframe frameborder="0" height="375" loading="lazy" src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/5231569?byline=0&portrait=0&color=999966" width="500"></iframe> </div><div class="caption-text"> A video shot with the iPhone 3G S: a vast improvement on many camcorders. </div></div></div></div></div>All in all, it’s actually a collection of minor upgrades with nothing spectacular, but a lot of the issues that people have been complaining about have been addressed.

Now if only they would fix the spam problems with MobileMe mail and allow users to use their own domain, [two issues I had complained about nearly a year ago](https://www.donaldjenkins.com/powerful-clever-mobileme/ "Powerful clever MobileMe"), I might even consider using [MobileMe](http://www.apple.com/mobileme/ "Apple - MobileMe - Your iPhone, Mac, and PC. In perfect sync.") for email instead of using it for calendar and contact items and relying on [Google Apps Premier Edition](http://www.google.com/apps/intl/en/business/details.html "Google Apps for business – details and pricing") for email.
