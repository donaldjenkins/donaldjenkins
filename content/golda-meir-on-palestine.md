excerpt: "> There were no such thing as Palestinians. When was there an independent Palestinian people with a Palestinian state? It was either southern Syria before the First World War, and then it was a Palestine including Jordan. It was not as though there was a Palestinian people in Palestine considering itself as a Palestinian people and we came and threw them out and took their country away from them. They did not exist.\n\n(Golda Meir, *Sunday Times*, June 15 1969; *The Washington Post*, June 16 1969) "
