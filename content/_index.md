Donald read Philosophy, Politics and Economics at [Magdalen College, Oxford](http://www.magd.ox.ac.uk/), and government at [École nationale d’administration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89cole_nationale_d%27administration).

## Articles

I don’t just take pictures, I also write. The full list of topics is on the [Articles](/articles/) page, but I mainly write about [politics](/politics/), [tech](/tech/), and [culture](/culture/). In addition to subjects of a strictly [personal](/personal/) nature, I’ve also occasionally written about [literature](/literature/) and [religion](/religion/).

Politics are hardly a side interest, as can be seen from the articles collected here. I first indulged my taste for [politics](/politics/) and current affairs at Oxford at the [Oxford Union Society](http://www.oxford-union.org/ "More on Oxford Union Society"), and then as a student in Paris, where I was President of [Conférence Olivaint](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conf%C3%A9rence_Olivaint "Conférence Olivaint is the oldest of the French student societies, established in 1875").

Subjects I’m passionate about include [code](https://stackoverflow.com/users/265324/donald-jenkins "Donald's Stack Overflow profile"), good [web design](https://dribbble.com/donaldjenkins "Donald's Dribbble profile"), Net neutrality, and avoiding government interference in the Internet. I write a lot about Apple-related stuff, blogging techniques and trends in social networks.

My interests span contemporary art, which has surrounded me ever since my infancy, [heraldry](https://cdn.donaldjenkins.com/documents/jenkins-arms-large.jpg?lossy=1&w=2560&ssl=1 "The Jenkins arms are blazoned Azure, two Chevronels each curving outwards and chief wards at the apex and there expanding into a point flory Gold. And for the crest upon a helm with a wreath Or and Azure A horse's head affronty coupled at the neck Azure and jest de lis Gold"), music, especially from Mozart up to the mid-Romantic period, as well as well-sung English choral music from the sixteenth, seventeenth and nineteenth centuries. I have worked in the field of culture and media in various capacities.

Go to the [Articles](/articles/) page for a full list, and bear in mind I write irregularly.
