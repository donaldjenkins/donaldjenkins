## Definitions · Agreement to Terms

These Terms and Conditions of Use (the Terms), as well as the separately available [Privacy Policy](/legal/privacy/), which is incorporated by reference into these Terms, apply to your access and use of this Website (www.donaldjenkins.com), and by extension to any subdomains or related websites operated by Donald Jenkins. They establish a framework for what you can expect from us, as well as for what we can expect from you.

Understanding these Terms is important, because, to use this Website, you must accept these terms. If you do not agree, [do not use this Website](https://tosdr.org/).

Because everyone (not just lawyers) should be able to easily understand the nature of any agreement into which they are entering, we use common language instead of more formal terms throughout this Terms. Here is a table of the key terms:
