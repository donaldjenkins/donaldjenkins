I started publishing articles in 2005, initially more as a rather frivolous diary than a set of thought-out articles, of which I have left only a part online. As my interest in, and relative grasp of, [code](https://github.com/donaldjenkins) and web development grew, I also began posting about my experience in that area. I now write mostly about British and French politics and my ongoing journey as a coder. Everything of any length I have written is here, but, obviously, you can look me up on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/donaldjenkins) if you yearn for more frequent updates.
