description: "Donald Jenkins mainly writes about [politics](https://www.donaldjenkins.com/politics/), [tech](https://www.donaldjenkins.com/tech/), and [culture](https://www.donaldjenkins.com/culture/)."
summary: "I don’t just take pictures, I also write. The full list of topics is on the [Articles](https://www.donaldjenkins.com/articles/) page, but I mainly write about [politics](https://www.donaldjenkins.com/politics/), [tech](https://www.donaldjenkins.com/tech/), and [culture](https://www.donaldjenkins.com/culture/). In addition to subjects of a strictly [personal](https://www.donaldjenkins.com/personal/) nature, I’ve also occasionally written about [literature](https://www.donaldjenkins.com/literature/) and [religion](https://www.donaldjenkins.com/religion/)."
personal: "This includes a wide range of miscellaneous topics—inevitably inducing an impression of boundless eclecticism."
culture: "My interests span contemporary art, which has surrounded me ever since my infancy, [heraldry](https://cdn.donaldjenkins.com/documents/jenkins-arms-large.jpg?lossy=1&w=2560&ssl=1), music, especially from Mozart up to the mid-Romantic period, as well as well-sung English choral music from the sixteenth, seventeenth and nineteenth centuries. I have worked in the field of culture and media in various capacities."
politics: "Politics are hardly a side interest, as can be seen from the articles collected here. I first indulged my taste for [politics](https://www.donaldjenkins.com/politics/) and current affairs at Oxford at the [Oxford Union Society](http://www.oxford-union.org/), and then as a student in Paris, where I was President of [Conférence Olivaint](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conférence_Olivaint)."
tech: "Subjects I’m passionate about include [code](https://stackoverflow.com/users/265324/donald-jenkins)**, good** [web design](https://dribbble.com/donaldjenkins), Net neutrality, and avoiding government interference in the Internet. I write a lot about  Apple-related stuff, blogging techniques and trends in social networks."
literature: "My favourite authors are those who wrote after the turn of the nineteenth century, but before the death of Camus, which still leaves quite a wide range. This happens to coincide with the so-called {{% quote %}}période grammaticale{{% /quote %}}, a period during which form was deemed to matter more than substance, not because substance did not matter, but because form was the surest way of gauging the true value of the substance behind it—a view with which I heartily agree."
religion: "Like the first Queen Elizabeth, I firmly believe in not putting windows into men’s souls (oral tradition, the words very possibly originating in a letter drafted by [Bacon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Bacon); in J. B. Black _[Reign of Elizabeth 1558–1603](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-reign-of-elizabeth-1558-1603-9780198217015?cc=fr&lang=en&)_ [1936]). Yet like the second Queen of the same name, I take my religion (relatively) seriously and have occasionally shared thoughts about the subject here."
sundry: "These articles don’t fit neatly into this site’s topics. Their presence here probably bears witness the incorrigible eclecticity of my range of interests."

I started publishing articles in 2005, initially more as a rather frivolous diary than a set of thought-out articles, of which I have left only a part online. As my interest in, and relative grasp of, [code](https://github.com/donaldjenkins) and web development grew, I also began posting about my experience in that area. I now write mostly about British and French politics and my ongoing journey as a coder. Everything of any length I have written is here, but, obviously, you can look me up on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/donaldjenkins) if you yearn for more frequent updates.
