description: "I’ve succumbed to the trend. Here’s the list of stuff I couldn’t possibly do without."
summary: "Taking inspiration from Michael Arrington and Kevin Rose (I didn’t think Kevin Rose would ever be a source of inspiration, but maybe I’m just feeling lazy), I’ve succumbed to the trend. Here’s the list of stuff I couldn’t possibly do without. It’s much shorter than theirs, and has all the right, cool stuff. If I’m still around, I’ll update it in 2011."

Taking inspiration from [Michael Arrington](https://techcrunch.com/2009/01/04/2009-products-i-cant-live-without/ "Michael Arrington 2009 list of supposedly indispensable stuff") and [Kevin Rose](https://kevinrose.com/post/466122892 "Kevin Rose list of supposedly indispensable stuff") (I didn’t think Kevin Rose would ever be a source of inspiration, but maybe I’m just feeling lazy), I’ve succumbed to the trend. Here’s the list of stuff I couldn’t possibly do without. It’s much shorter than theirs, and has all the right, cool stuff. If I’m still around, I’ll update it in 2011.
