Taking inspiration from [Michael Arrington](http://techcrunch.com/2009/01/04/2009-products-i-cant-live-without/ "Michael Arrington 2009 list of supposedly indispensable stuff") and [Kevin Rose](http://kevinrose.com/post/466122892 "Kevin Rose list of supposedly indispensable stuff") (I didn’t think Kevin Rose would ever be a source of inspiration, but maybe I’m just feeling lazy), I’ve succumbed to the trend.
