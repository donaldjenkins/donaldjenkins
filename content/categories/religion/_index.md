description: "Like the first Queen Elizabeth, I firmly believe in not putting windows into men’s souls (oral tradition, the words very possibly originating in a letter drafted by Bacon; in J. B. Black _Reign of Elizabeth 1558–1603_ [1936]). Yet like the second Queen of the same name, I take my religion (relatively) seriously and have occasionally shared thoughts about the subject here."
