description: "Politics are hardly a side interest, as can be seen from the articles collected here. I first indulged my taste for [politics](/politics/) **and current affairs at Oxford at the** [Oxford Union Society](http://www.oxford-union.org/), and then as a student in Paris, where I was President of [Conférence Olivaint](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conférence_Olivaint)."
