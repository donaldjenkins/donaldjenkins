<figure>> To every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven:
> 
> A time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to pluck up that which is planted;
> 
> A time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to break down, and a time to build up;
> 
> A time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance;
> 
> A time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones together; a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing;
> 
> A time to get, and a time to lose; a time to keep, and a time to cast away;
> 
> A time to rend, and a time to sew; a time to keep silence, and a time to speak;
> 
> A time to love, and a time to hate; a time of war, and a time of peace.
