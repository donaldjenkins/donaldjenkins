      <title>Backing up a Mac to Amazon S3 with Arq: the easiest, safest and most accurate solution</title>

      <description>Mac is among the most difficult systems to backup and restore correctly: Macs have peculiarities; resource forks and packages, for example, are unique to the Mac, and not every service handles them well. My experience of the more popular commercial backup services has not been good: they&amp;rsquo;re unreliable, slow and raise privacy and data safety concerns. Using Amazon S3, in combination with a robust yet simple backup tool provided by small startup Arq, which I&amp;rsquo;ve just discovered, provides a much more reliable alternative.</description>

      <title>A plea in support of Mr Obama&#39;s perfectible health-care bill</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m in no doubt that America needs universal health care for the same reasons that Europe needed it in 1945: it&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo;s morally unacceptable, in a rich society, that anyone should be denied it for financial reasons. The bill presently before Congress is clearly perfectible, but in reality, arguments against it are but thinly-veiled pretexts barely concealing the selfishness and economic ignorance underlying Mr Obama&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo;s opponents on this issue..</description>

      <description>A short post written at a challenging time. Yet one of the many the beautiful things about hardship, when it strikes, is that spiritual comfort is always there when one needs it.</description>

      <title>Abomination in Iran</title>

      <description>My first real blog post was about an abomination. I have not been able to get the devastating news about the mollah regime in power in Iran&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo;s hanging of two innocent teenagers, for the sole reason that they were in a relationship. That a country that used to be the most western-friendly, modern and open society in the region to fallen into the hands of these bloodthirsty, barbarian thugs is simply inexplicable by rational means</description>
