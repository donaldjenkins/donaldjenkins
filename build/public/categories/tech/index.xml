      <description>Mac is among the most difficult systems to backup and restore correctly: Macs have peculiarities; resource forks and packages, for example, are unique to the Mac, and not every service handles them well. My experience of the more popular commercial backup services has not been good: they&amp;rsquo;re unreliable, slow and raise privacy and data safety concerns. Using Amazon S3, in combination with a robust yet simple backup tool provided by small startup Arq, which I&amp;rsquo;ve just discovered, provides a much more reliable alternative.</description>

      <description>The time has come to consolidate all the posts I’ve written since 2005 in a variety of guises, in one language and one site. The language, of course, had to be English and the site had to be donaldjenkins.com. I did toy for a while with the idea of running a bilingual blog. But the SEO implications of this were unclear and I thought it might be overkill. So I translated all the old blog posts, which hadn’t been available online for nearly two years, and uploaded them, for the first time, to this site. They have occasionally been made more concise, and comments (which were in French anyway) haven’t been preserved. You can browse through them by visiting the archives.</description>
