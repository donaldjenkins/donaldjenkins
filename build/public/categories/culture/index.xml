      <description>Over the past four years, Gerard Mortier has presided over a quiet revolution in style, matched by a major shift in the audience of that venerable Parisian institution. He initially got the backs up the stuffy Parisians who traditionally make up the institution’s audience, in blissful ignorance of the true artistic merits of what they have been watching.</description>

      <description>I’m always uncomfortable with Strauss. I find him impossible to fathom, which makes me deeply unpopular in certain circles. Salome, which I went to see a few months ago, was a terribly difficult experience. Many of my friends found it wonderful. So I wasn’t feeling my best when I set off with a friend to the Opera Bastille to see Rosenkavalier, whose first performance I had missed in December</description>

      <title>Idomeneo: a lyrical turning point</title>

      <description>Idomeneo is a major turning-point, not just in Mozart’s music, but in the history of opera. Albert Einstein said of Idomeneo that it was one of those works that even a genius of the highest rank like Mozart could only write once in his life. And it’s unquestionably radically different from anything Mozart composed before or afterwards.</description>

      <description>A quick review of &lt;em&gt;Les Troyens&lt;/em&gt;, arguably France&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo;s most beautiful opera, and rather inexplicably quite misunderstood. Gerard Mortier, director of the Paris Opera, has rightly gone against this trend by making it the highlight of the year&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo;s season.</description>

      <title>Chopin: such appropriate music for a ballet</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/chopin-such-appropriate-music-for-a-ballet/</link>

      <guid>//localhost:1313/chopin-such-appropriate-music-for-a-ballet/</guid>
      <description>A review of &lt;em&gt;La Dame aux camellias&lt;/em&gt; directed by Neumaier, Americas most European choreographer. A truly splendid production with the world’s best ballet company, sublime music, Jürgen Rose’s breathtakingly beautiful costumes. The music was superb, but Chopin was a frequent source of inspiration for choreographers, so Neumeier is merely following established precedent here.</description>

      <description>A review of Neumeier&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;La Dame aux camellias&lt;/em&gt;. I wonder why it took so long for this wonderful ballet piece, created in 1978, to be included in the Opera’s &lt;em&gt;répertoire&lt;/em&gt;.</description>

      <description>A review of the film about Truman, Capote, in which one deliberately veers somewhat off-topic, focusing more on the curious way in which he approached the death penalty on the occasion of his trip to Kansas.</description>

      <description>Don Giovanni is Mozart’s most avantgardist opera: it was a major benchmark for nineteenth-century composers. Yet Haneke who directed this production, was booed copiously at Friday’s first performance.</description>
