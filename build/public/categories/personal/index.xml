      <description>A quick introduction to Policymakr, the new start-up I&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo;ve been planning since the dramatic events of 2016, and which I&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo;ve finally decided to launch. And a little question-and-answer session, as an added bonus.</description>

      <description>Taking inspiration from Michael Arrington and Kevin Rose (I didn’t think Kevin Rose would ever be a source of inspiration, but maybe I’m just feeling lazy), I’ve succumbed to the trend. Here’s the list of stuff I couldn’t possibly do without. It’s much shorter than theirs, and has all the right, cool stuff. If I’m still around, I’ll update it in 2011.</description>

      <description>My difficult start to a new decade, and the tribulations of the French healthcare system, which is still probably the world&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo;s best.

      <description>A short post written at a challenging time. Yet one of the many the beautiful things about hardship, when it strikes, is that spiritual comfort is always there when one needs it.</description>
