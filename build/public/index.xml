      <description>&gt; But for the sake of some little mouthful of flesh we deprive a soul of the sun and light, and of that proportion of life and time it had been born into the world to enjoy. Plutarch, [Moralia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moralia), The Eating of Animal Flesh, 1.4![Undercover investigation at Chinos Hallmark Westland slaughterhouse (2008)](https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/1000759647-d07e6f3783e80cac80418fe140da492755dabc6980634e949fe01bbabceb37b3-d_960) In 2008, tens of millions of Americans watched with horror and disbelief when they saw on their evening news an undercover video of cattle too sick to walk being kicked, shocked with electric prods, jabbed in the eye with a baton, and pushed around with a forklift, all so that they could be driven near enough to the kill box to be slaughtered and processed into meat.</description>

      <title>Brexit: time to move on</title>

      <description>I opposed the initiative, which won the referendum on Brexit in June 2016, for the United Kingdom to leave the European Union. I saw no merit in the Leave camp’s claim that British sovereignty and independence were somehow impaired by membership. I believed then, and still believe, that we benefited from the cohesion, economies of scale and frictionless trade environment brought about by our free choice to delegate a number of tasks to an entity responsible for carrying them out for the collective benefit of participating members.</description>

      <title>Connecting WordPress, Lightroom and Apple Photos</title>

      <description>While any serious photographer will use several cameras and lenses, the dramatic improvement in the quality of Apple’s iPhone cameras has led many people, me included, to take the majority of their photographs on their phones. A lot of these pictures may end up on an Instagram or Facebook profile—easily done directly from an iPhone—rather than a WordPress site. But if, like me, you wish to keep your photographs in some semblance of order and also display them on your site, the iPhone will have introduced additional complexity into your workflow.</description>

      <description>Photos ====== As Apple started producing increasingly seriously good cameras in their phones, I started using my phone for the vast majority of my pictures. Many of the pictures on this page were taken with one. For serious pictures, have a look at Flickr, for more frequent updates, go to Instagram. I tend to prefer working in black and white, but that isn’t by any means a systematic rule.

      <description>In the weeks since I last wrote on this site, I’ve been incredibly busy working on a new exciting project, and I believe the time is ripe to share it with you.
In the summer and autumn of 2016, which I spent in the US and in Israel, I became increasingly preoccupied with the disappearance of civility from online, and also from real-life politics.
The aftermath of the Brexit referendum, which left me in a state of complete shock, and directly witnessing, away from the sanitized East Coast where I spend most of my time, the acrimony and hard words that marred the US primaries, and then the presidential election itself, left me reeling in disbelief.</description>

      <description>The new design for this website§, the successor to the Belgravia theme I had been using since 2012, which I’m calling Gramercy, and which I hope you will like, goes live this week. But behind the hood quite a lot has changed beyond the design.
In the thirteen years since I started publishing content on this site, I think I’ve measured up to the challenge I identified in my first online article:</description>

      <description>Donald started publishing articles in 2005. A selection of his older contributions, listed below, is still online and new ones will continue to be published when inspiration and circumstances so dictate. Most of his articles are here, but, obviously, you can look him up on Twitter if you yearn for more frequent updates from him.
This includes a wide range of miscellaneous topics—inevitably inducing an impression of boundless eclecticism.

      <description>As someone who travels internationally fairly extensively, juggling with multiple phone numbers and SIM cards to match the countries I visit most frequently has always been technically irritating and, unless much care is given, financially draining.
Like most people nowadays I hardly ever make voice calls And the unlimited voice plans still offered by most providers don’t at all match my requirements. My data usage, on the other hand, has for a while been colossal, since my typical day is spent pretty much constantly connected, checking facts and news online, uploading and downloading media and using social social accounts.</description>

      <guid>//localhost:54709/brexit-would-be-constitutional-and-economic-suicide/</guid>
      <description>With the horrific shock of the Brexit referendum result now a few days old, a clearer picture is beginning to emerge, from which possible paths can be outlined to keep the United Kingdom from disintegrating, constitutionally, economically and, yet more importantly, as a moral force for good in the world.
There should be no doubt in anyone’s mind, regardless of their party affiliation, that we are facing the most serious crisis since the fall of Singapore at the hands of the Japanese in 1942, or perhaps even since the Civil War.</description>

      <description>It’s been three years since I’ve posted anything to this blog. My Twitter feed has effectively replaced blogging. I probably needed a good excuse to resume writing more than 140-character thoughts and clearly if I didn’t grasp the opportunity provided by the referendum that the Government has decided to call on withdrawal from the European Union, it would have meant that I would simply never have written an article again.</description>

      <description>One problem I have increasingly faced over the past four years or so, as my websites became more complex, was the need to maintain a large, constantly-evolving and unwieldy set of stylesheets. I’ve been writing all the code for this myself for some time now. Every few months, I have tended to rethink the structure of my main site: design standards evolve so fast that I find I need the constant challenge of starting from scratch, just to keep on top of the phenomenally rapid pace of change in an industry in which nine months are akin to a lifetime.</description>

      <description>We celebrate today the sixtieth anniversary of Her Majesty The Queen’s accession. Those of my fellow citizens who, like I, throughout the Commonwealth, have had the privilege of being her subjects for our entire lives must often — out of habit and, perhaps, a very English need for understatement in all things, especially the more important ones — have taken our Sovereign for granted. Yet I think it appropriate today to reflect on what we owe Her Majesty as a nation, as does the vibrant community of countries whose unity she has symbolised for all these years.</description>

      <description>After completing the switch to html5, switching from .net to .com, accompanied by a new design, I wanted to update my server configuration, which hadn’t changed for three years.
In this post, I’ll recount how I set up my new (ve) server, combining it with one of Media Temple’s ProCDN accounts so that tasks are clearly apportioned between the two:

      <description>If you’re reading this in a feed reader—which I hope you are—you won’t be aware that the template for this theme has been completely changed. Every year, as regularly as clockwork, just before spring, I seem to get inspired to rewrite the code for my theme from scratch. The last time this happened was last year, when I switched to a resolutely minimalist style and a theme that I had entirely written from scratch.</description>

      <description>In a concession to both modern grammatical usage (call me old-fashioned, but I’m not a fan of ending my sentence with prepositions§ ) and current trends, I published a post a year ago, listing stuff I couldn’t live without in 2010, promising that I’d update it if I were still around in 2011.
As a year has gone by, it seems appropriate to share my latest thoughts on the matter. One is immediately struck, of course, on reading this list, by the dichotomy between my real-world environment and my online one: lasting values make up the former, with nothing changed since 2010, trends and frivolity the latter.</description>

      <description>Facebook have recently quietly announced that they would be rolling out their much-talked-about new messaging system to most users over the next few weeks. The excitement about the new feature has largely died down since it was announced on November 15 last year, but as people start using it more extensively, it will be interesting to see how it fares.
A grandiose new ‘presence Management’ system? It’s worth remembering that in Facebook’s eyes, the new system is emphatically not email, but rather what Gigaom‘s David Card called ‘Presence Management, or ‘the tools and platforms a person uses to announce his availability to other people (and, potentially, to bot and services’).</description>

      <description>In recent weeks, like others, I’ve been becoming increasingly frustrated with Google Search. Whenever I’m making anything other than the most basic of searches, I find my results are being increasingly polluted by totally irrelevant results and in some cases by complete gibberish. I feel slightly embarrassed admitting this, since I’m also, ironically, rather pleased with the way Google indexes this site: it shows up on the front page of many Google search results on subjects I’ve covered here, and a massive three quarters of my readers originally landed here as a result of a Google search—and practically none from the other search engines.</description>

      <description>Sparrow Mail, which I am certain will soon establish itself as the best email client for the Mac, launches today on the Mac App Store.
Creating an email client from scratch is very difficult: this explains more than anything else why so few genuinely new email clients are available for the Mac, outside of Apple Mail which comes bundled in with OS X. So the launch of Sparrow Mail§ is actually a major event, since only a few competitors to Apple Mail are available.</description>

Things have picked up in 2011, I suppose, as I am writing this from the comfort of my bed, to which I was confined by influenza for most of the Twelve Days of Christmas, my fever and aching dropping just in time for the Feast of the Epiphany.
While on a personal front I have no comment to offer as yet about the past year, I would like to highlight how, to me, it has been an exceptionally uplifting one at home, seen from my Continental exile.</description>

      <description>I’ve made no secret of the fact that I’ve been using my MacBook Air a lot more than my iPad in the past month, since it’s actually lighter (if you take into account the fact that it needs a separate bluetooth keyboard to function), more powerful (since it runs OS X, rather than iOS) and has a much wider choice of apps to use, especially for blogging. In fact, I found myself only using my iPad to read The Economist, the Spectator and the Financial Times online editions (the former two being glorified PDF versions of their paper selves, the latter underwhelming in its mediocrity, yet all three more convenient than waiting for delivery by a newsboy).</description>

      <description>&gt; \[Benedict XVI\] There may be a basis in the case of some individuals, as perhaps when a male prostitute uses a condom, where this can be a first step in the direction of a moralisation, a first assumption of responsibility, on the way toward recovering an awareness that not everything is allowed and that one cannot do whatever one wants \[…\] &gt; &gt; *\[Peter Seewald\] Are you saying, then, that the Catholic Church is actually not opposed in principle to the use of condoms?</description>

      <description>Mac is among the most difficult systems to backup and restore correctly: Macs have peculiarities; resource forks and packages, for example, are unique to the Mac, and not every service handles them well.
Few people pay much attention to this until they experience data loss through hardware damage, material error, theft or some other act of God the consequences of which can prove impossible to repair.
The characteristic reaction to this, by many users, is simply to ignore the issue altogether and bank on the fact that data loss is unlikely to occur.</description>

      <description>As I was half-expecting, Facebook is now seriously rumoured to be about to announce the launch of an email service at the special event it is holding on Monday.
Because barriers to entry in email are high, Facebook will probably end up disproportionately attracting one demographic—teenagers—to its rumoured new email service Also as expected, speculation is now wild that Facebook will end up killing Gmail, Hotmail and all the other existing email providers:</description>

      <description>We have a long and, on the whole, distinguished history of acting in concert with the French in military matters ever since the end of the last of our many conflicts, the revolutionary and Napoleonic wars, in 1815. Whether at Navarino in 1827, in the Crimean War in the 1850s, the two World Wars and, of course, the Suez Crisis, which was the last time that we acted together — and which, militarily, was a complete success — the record of Anglo-French cooperation has been superb.</description>

      <title>Will Facebook end up like Microsoft after making the same closed platform strategic mistake?</title>

      <description>Until about 1996, Microsoft was the most significant company in tech, arguably the only significant one. Then Mr Bill Gates misread the emergence of the Internet, and by that one fateful mistake embarked the once-exciting company he had built from nothing on a long path towards decline and irrelevance. The parallel with Facebook in 2010 is not as forceful as all that, of course: Facebook has not achieved anything like Microsoft’s dominance of the tech sector; its ambitions, however, are arguably just as great.</description>

      <description>I’ve always been enamoured of miniature objects and have since childhood been fascinated by the technical prowess involved in reducing the size of electronic devices: mobile phones were probably the area in which this process has been most spectacular, but it’s worth putting this post, written on my new gadget using my favourite WriteRoom Text editor for the Mac, in perspective by recalling just how much laptop size has changed a lot since I acquired my first portable computer, a black, French-made 1990 SMT Goupil Golf that cost an absolute fortune.</description>

      <description>Google’s recent announcement that it was making its goo.gl URL shortener available to anyone has revived discussion about URL shortening services—which has been an on-again, off-again subject for much of the past two years. It hasn’t, though, changed the way in which I use them, basically because in their present state they aren’t very important to me. And the real issue here is not actually URL shortening, which will always remain a low-end, commodity service.</description>

      <description>Apple’s choice of iTunes as the repository for its social network was a major strategic mistake Back in 2007, when I unboxed and activated my first iPhone, I remember my surprise at being required to manage it in iTunes. Until then, for me, iTunes was an application for playing music and sending it to my iPod. Using it to manage settings on a telephone spontaneously seemed rather counterintuitive.
Of course, the iPhone was, from the outset, designed as the iPod’s bigger, voice-enabled cousin.</description>

      <description>I was little severe about the new camera in my blog post about the new iPhone 4, because I was a little disappointed by the photographs it produced, compared with my compact Canon S90, and because I assumed it would be a while before existing iPhone photo apps would be updated by their developers to take advantage of the new five-megapixel resolution, which produces photographs of a size of 2592 × 1936 pixels, up from the iPhone 3GS’s 1536 × 2048 (3,1 MP).</description>

      <description>&gt; The Web is a teeming commercial city. It’s haphazardly planned. Its public spaces are mobbed, and signs of urban decay abound in broken links and abandoned projects. Malware and spam have turned living conditions in many quarters unsafe and unsanitary. Bullies and hucksters roam the streets. An entrenched population of rowdy, polyglot rabble seems to dominate major sites. &gt; &gt; People who find the Web distasteful — ugly, uncivilized — have nonetheless been forced to live there: it’s the place to go for jobs, resources, services, social life, the future.</description>

      <description>As I write this from New York, The Queen has yet to call for someone to ask him to take over from Mr Brown’s outgoing Socialist administration following last week’s General Election and the resulting hung Parliament.
Much has already been written about this, so I’m not going to analyse the result yet again. The best Tory view on what we should hope for was perhaps expressed by Toby Young in the Daily Telegraph on Friday.</description>

      <description>In the space of just over two years, Facebook has gone from being my favourite website to being one I hardly ever visit and that I am seriously contemplating leaving altogether.
When I opened my Facebook profile in 2007, I saw it as a way of sharing content with friends: people I knew in real life and with whom I wanted to interact privately, secure in the knowledge that what we shared was not available to the hoi polloi.</description>

      <description>Keeping your data in the cloud, to use a current phrase that people don’t always clearly understand, actually means storing your data on a web-based server and accessing the data via the Internet using any combination of desktop and mobile clients. The point of cloud computing, if you use Apple hardware (a Mac at home, a laptop, an iPhone and maybe an iPad), is keeping your data in sync, seamlessly, without having to worry about where you edit your information.</description>

      <description>Just over a year ago, I moved to writing under my own name, after four years of blogging under a pseudonym. Of course an individual’s circumstances (his job, in particular) will dictate how much leeway he has to make or not to make his thoughts on certain subjects public. My decision to do so was the result of a number of factors, not least the shift towards posting content under your own name that had broken into the mainstream with the spectacular rise to prominence of Facebook — which has from the start been designed for users to join under their real names.</description>

      <description>I first wrote about the way I write my WordPress blog posts in 2007, and updated the method I described for using WriteRoom, TextMate and and desktop blogging software in 2009. Available tools have changed slightly since then, and I’ve also changed the way I use them. So a short update is needed here.
WordPress itself has improved considerably in the past three years, to the point that writing blog posts in the wp-admin web interface is now a real option for those who want to keep their blogging simple and aren’t interested either in refinements or in using code.</description>

      <description>&gt; We consider the amendments concerning royal marriages and succession to the Crown to be human rights enhancing measures. Discrimination against Catholics in the law of marriage is contrary to Article 14 ECHR in conjunction with Article 12 and also arguably contrary to the freedom of religion of Catholics protected by Article 9 ECHR. Male primogeniture in the law of inheritance generally is in our view arguably contrary to Article 14 ECHR in conjunction with Article 1 Protocol 1.</description>

      <description>I started blogging in July 2005, using the wrong software and posting to my .Mac account. By the following February, I was using WordPress but posting in French. A sort of blogging golden age, that lasted from 2006 to 2008, followed, coinciding with a period when I worked rather hard and also went out quite a lot. Hence the opera reviews. In the summer of 2008, after a spending time in South Africa and hardly blogging at all, I switched to blogging in English: about six out of ten visitors are English-speaking, the remainder being mainly French, so I’m quite pleased I made that decision.</description>

      <description>America remains, puzzlingly, the world’s only truly innovative economy In the 1980s, there was for a while a widespread perception of American decline, perhaps best popularized by Lester C. Thurow’s best-seller The Zero Sum Solution§. This was believed to be evident in the industrial sector and not offset by any marked achievement in other areas. With Europe mired in what was then termed eurosclerosis, the emerging Asian economies were seen as the obvious winners of the future.</description>

      <description>In the four and a half years since I started blogging, the tools available for that futile exercise have dramatically improved. After a few months experimenting with other blogging platforms, mostly of the hosted variety, I settled with WordPress in early 2006 and have never had any reason to regret that choice. It’s the most powerful, flexible tool by far and because of its popularity, available tools to customize it are almost endless.</description>

      <description>Be honest: when did you last use your del.icio.us account? You just use Twitter, right? Social networking, which was in its infancy when I started using it in 2006, has matured. Three years ago, a vast number of start-ups were competing in the field, and few people other than geeks actually bothered to use them. Today the sector is much more concentrated, meaning it makes sense not to use every social network in existence§.</description>

      <description>Burke, the soundest reference from an English perspective and, arguably, ceteris paribus, from most others also, would have had this to say about the Swiss practice of referenda:
&gt; \[…\]It ought to be the happiness and glory of a representative to live in the strictest union, the closest correspondence, and the most unreserved communication with his constituents. Their wishes ought to have great weight with him; their opinion, high respect; their business, unremitted attention.</description>

      <description>I am deeply distressed by the current treatment of the disturbances in Iran by the media and the blogosphere.
These are the same wishy-washy, liberal elite that deliberately allowed Iran to be taken over by a bunch of reactionary thugs in 1979. In doing so, they thrust a once great nation that had achieved a remarkably modernisation under the Pahlavi dynasty and could legitimately aspire to be one of the five greatest non-nuclear§ powers in world first into chaos, then into an orgy of repression, torture, murder, corruption and the promotion of ignorance, terrorism, that has lasted for thirty years.</description>

      <description>It looks like I was the first person to have activated a newly-acquired iPhone 3G S. The people at Orange called me yesterday to ask whether I wanted to collect mine at midnight, as they were opening their Champs-Elysées store specially for the occasion, making them the first retail outlet in the world to sell the new phones as Paris is six hours ahead of Standard Eastern Time.
Because I’ve been using the iPhone from day one, the Orange team had arranged for me to be the first to collect a brand-new 32GB iPhone 3G S and they immediately activated it for me in-store.</description>

      <description>Now, the strategy of giving intellectual property away so that people will buy your paraphernalia won’t work equally well for everything. To take the obvious, painful example: news organizations, very much including this one, have spent years trying to turn large online readership into an adequately paying proposition, with limited success.
But they’ll have to find a way. Bit by bit, everything that can be digitized will be digitized, making intellectual property ever easier to copy and ever harder to sell for more than a nominal price.</description>

Isabelle de Charrière, Caliste ou suite des lettres écrites de Lausanne (1786)From Rousseau’s *Nouvelle Héloïse* to Malraux’s *Conquérants*, French letters since the eighteenth century are strongly coloured by death and, more particularly, by death wishes. In the last couple of weeks, I have been looking with considerable interest at this subject that most will regard as unnecessarily stern in an age where happiness has been erected into a moral imperative.</description>

But with the change in my life, interests and job that occurred last year, and also the decision to switch to English after three years of blogging in French, the time has come to draw the process to a logical conclusion and make this domain, donaldjenkins.</description>

      <description>On November 4 2008, I went downtown to Times Square with a friend after the inevitable result had come through and mingled with the crowd of New Yorkers celebrating the end of the hated Bush era. They were all young and enthusiastic and many of them convinced that they were on the eve of a new dawn. We even saw a red flag, complete with hammer and sickle. The scene was similar, I guess, to that in streets of Paris on May 10 1981 and, no doubt, to that enacted on many other, less iconic occasions.</description>

People’s reactions, not surprisingly, reflect their own deep-seated opinions and prejudices about a range of issues, some connected with that of the excommunication, some not.</description>

MobileMe felt like deliverance from evil after tinkering with Microsoft Exchange—but it has irritating issues of its own that Apple, which isn’t interested in delivering a credible cloud package, has done nothing to redress. I’ve now switched to Google Apps servers for everything, except for contacts and written an updated post on my 2010 configuration.
Just over a month after the launch of Apple’s MobileMe cloud computing suite, I have been using the service, coupled with the new iPhone 2.</description>

      <description>&gt; It hath been the wisdom of the Church of England, ever since the first compiling of her publick Liturgy, to keep the mean between the two extremes, of too much stiffness in refusing, and of too much easiness in admitting any variation from it. Preface to the Book of Common PrayerThe disarray in which the Lambeth Conference broke up just a few days ago has led to considerable and, often, incredibly misinformed scrutiny of the issue that, above any other, is dividing the various component parts of which is losely called the Anglican Communion: whether a Church should knowingly consecrate an openly gay man as a bishop.</description>

      <description>About a year ago, after the change in the French government that led to a change of jobs for me, my old blog, that I had started keeping, in French, on a beach near Saint-Tropez in August 2005, went into limbo. The subjects I was blogging about (French politics, opera and ballet in Paris, information technology, particularly) were just too eclectic to give the site any coherent sense of direction. More seriously, I simply didn’t feel inspired to write anything about them.</description>

      <description>I know I’d said I wouldn’t switch to an iPhone from my BlackBerry, essentially because i wasn’t happy that Apple had launched it without it being able to sync data over-the-air, something the BlackBerry has been able to do for years. I found it unacceptable to have to physically connect my phone to my Mac to do this. It felt like going back to an earlier, less civilised age.
The guys at the Orange VIP team, however, were clearly determined to get me as an early adopter on the day when the iPhone launched in France, six months later than in the US.</description>

      <description>One of the most interesting online developments in recent months has been the emergence of the notion of lifestream, as the Internet evolves into a place for people, not just to access information, but to actively exchange it with others, which has usually taken place on so-called social networks, bringing together many users with an interest in a particular field (photography, video, music, etc.)
This phenomenon is decentralised and increasingly interactive: users of online social services are fickle, using whichever online service is best in its field.</description>

      <description>&gt; Lorsque nos juristes officiels parlent de faire mourir sans faire souffrir, ils ne savent pas ce dont ils parlent et, surtout, ils manquent d’imagination[§](#bfn-footnotes-140). Albert Camus, Réflexions sur la guillotine, 1957I’ve been closely following the Supreme Court’s recent decision agreeing to hear a lethal injection challenge arising from Kentucky, [Baze v. Rees](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baze_v._Rees), on the grounds that it contravened the Eighth Amendment. There is growing realisation that a condemned prisoner’s suffering is real in many cases, but concealed by the protocol used§.</description>

      <description>Just as I suspected, I have found that the iPhone can only be synchronized via USB, using iTunes, to either a Macintosh platform or a supported Windows OS personal computer. Synchronization via Bluetooth, WiFi, terrestrial Ethernet or over a carrier network is not supported. This shows Apple were in such a rush to get the machine out that they didn’t bother to bring it up to its full potential beforehand.</description>

      <description>Stories have been rife on the web of people waiting to queue up to buy iPhones on June 29, when Apple releases the product. I was interested to see that Paul was not planning to get one despite being about as much of an Apple fanatic as I am. He’s planning to get a BlackBerry Curve instead. While I personally prefer the BlackBerry Pearl, which I have been using since Christmas, because it’s smaller than the Curve and I value space, it’s basically the same phone with a slightly different keyboard using SureType, a brilliant text entry recognition system far superior to T9, the system often found on other phones.</description>

      <description>[…] one of the most un-musical-like musicals that have recently graced the screen. Its formal honesty will be startling for those used to the baroque tongue-in-cheek musicals that are made nowadays.
(Rotten Tomatoes)
“But it’s a musical!” One of my acquaintances was convinced that I wouldn’t want to see Les chansons d’amour, especially after having disliked Christophe Honoré’s previous film, Dans Paris. Reading that Rotten Tomatoes review may put that idea to rest; This film could hardly be more French: the music fits the plot perfectly, the words are poetic but elegant as well, and they have no difficulty in sitting side-by-side with the heavily bourgeois-bohemian dialogues.</description>

      <description>There’s been a bit of a controversy, recently, on the subject of Limbo. One of my friends claimed, in his blog, somewhat simplistically, that the Pope had abolished it. I’ve also thought Limbo a fascinating subject, probably because I’ve very often desperately wanted to be in Limbo myself. And, after all, Limbo is a subject that should be of concern to everyone,because ending up there is something that happens rather easily.</description>

Prior to his departure to Syria he prays to the Virgin Mary that he will love the most beautiful woman and that he himself may be the bravest. His prayers are answered.

      <description>I’m always uncomfortable with Strauss. I find him impossible to fathom, which makes me deeply unpopular in certain circles. Salome, which I went to see a few months ago, was a terribly difficult experience. Many of my friends found it wonderful. So I wasn’t feeling my best when I set off with a friend to the Opera Bastille to see Rosenkavalier, whose first performance I had missed in December.
Rosenkavalier is different from Salome, though.</description>

Open to world and to all its cultures. This is the same old Europe that already existed before the Gospel was even preached there, marked by its pagan, Indo-European heritage.</description>

      <description>Idomeneo is a major turning-point, not just in Mozart’s music, but in the history of opera. Albert Einstein said of Idomeneo that it was one of those works that even a genius of the highest rank like Mozart could only write once in his life. And it’s unquestionably radically different from anything Mozart composed before or afterwards. It’s austere, with no background harpsichord music; there is a strong sense of continuity between its different parts; and even a hint of dissonance, which for the time is incredibly daring, as if Mozart were showing the way to Strauss; Idomeneo, the main part, is a powerful tenor, yet a castrato (mio molto amato castrato del prato) also plays a principal part in the first distribution; and Mozart innovates by introducing wind instruments, which was unprecedented in an opera.</description>

      <description>I’ve just given in to a French friend who insisted that I must absolutely read Les Bienveillantes, the prize-winning novel by a Mr Jonathan Littell, whose mother-tongue, as you might have guessed, is English.
I arrived in France at an age when most young people will already have read all of Balzac, Molière, Racine, Hugo and Proust. What little French books I had read in England I had adored, so I was determined to catch up and decided on a new rule: I would read nothing that had been written by an author who had started writing after the death of Camus, if only because at twenty years of age, I had an interminable list of books to read that my contemporaries already knew perfectly, and otherwise I would never catch up.</description>

The first performance had sold out ages ago. Then all my New York friends called to say they would be in Paris over the week-end of November 10. When the big day finally arrived, I was joined by François, who I knew would enjoy it, at Palais Garnier in the midst of a huge concourse of people, from both Paris and New York.</description>

      <description>The Aeneid, with the Odyssey, must surely be the Western world’s literary cornerstone. Berlioz knew it off by heart and his dream was to turn it into a great opera. He composed Les Troyens, a musical splendor with very explicit hints at Gluck, between 1853 and 1858, writing the libretto himself. It was created in 1863 at the Théâtre-lyrique, but was divided into two parts because Napoleon II never showed any support for it.</description>

I jumped at the opportunity to have a second look La Dame aux camélias, by Neumeier, rightly described by the programme as America’s most European choreographer. I’d seen it once already in June but, with hindsight, there had been too many distractions on that opening night.</description>

      <description>I’ve finally found something to wear that’s rather nice and isn’t Dior. During the summer break, Parisian clothes shops, from the smartest to the shabbiest, stock up on new items in preparation for the rentrée. Because in Paris it’s an absolute rule that shops must make life for their customers as unpleasant as possible, they do this on purpose just when most people are away on holiday. Loads of people, every year, take the wrong clothes with them on holiday: I went to Saint-Tropez last year without the pink t-shirts and white cargo trousers that everybody else seemed to be wearing that year, which was very embarrassing.</description>

      <description>French-speaking Canada at the time of the Quiet Revolution has always fascinated me, for two reasons in particular:
First, it should be recalled that Quebec is the equivalent, for the French, of the Old Commonwealth for the British. Is means the same, to them, or ought to anyway, as the United States, English-speaking Canada, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa means to us. The French should have remained inconsolable after losing what Voltaire snottily described as “quelques arpents de neige.</description>

The story of the murder of the Clutter family caused a bit of a stir in 1959. Enough of one, at any rate, to draw the attention of author and journalist Truman Capote. The sequel is well-known: Mr Capote wrote a book on the case, which I have to say I haven’t read, published only after the two convicted murderers had exhausted their appeals and been executed, on April 14, 1965.</description>

This unpretentious designer has produced yet another beautiful collection: black is back, and gone are the hideous colours introduced for the 2005-2006 collection, which I didn’t like one bit. The models were wearing much shorter hair, slicked back with quite a bit of gel. The overall style was rather romantic in a Beau-Brummel sort of way.
The technical side had been perfectly crafted by Thierry Dreyfus: the show started off in total darkness, to the point that one had to grope about to find one’s seat.</description>

      <description>An animated discussion took place between myself and two other others at the Café de la Paix after seeing Haneke’s Don Giovanni at the Palais Garnier, the first performance of which I had missed to attend Jean de Saint-Guilhem’s concert.
Don Giovanni is Mozart’s most avantgardist opera: it was a major banchmark for nineteenth-century composers. On person at the table adored the opera, but hated this production. I, on the other hand, liked Don Giovanni rather less than Mozart’s other operas, despite Kobbe telling us that, for many years, it was preferred to any other.</description>

Jean may not be Jorge Bolet, but his rendering of this peice, taken from Harmonies poétiques et religieuses, vividly brought forth the composer’s deep sorrow at the time he wrote it, just after the failed Hungarian rising in 1849.</description>

Last July, the heat had been unbearable. This time it was freezing. Karl had designed a circular stage around a huge white tower. We all received a blanket and a Chanel thermos full of hot coffee. I felt sorry for the scantily-clad models.
Speaking of the models, Herr Lagerfeld always seems to use the same girls, including a lot of red-heads.</description>

      <description>I’ve just spent a fantastic week-end at Toulouse, staying with my good friends Louis-Roch and Vanessa, who have been out there for a year and badly missing Paris. Despite not being crazy about the French provinces myself, I’m extremely fond of them, so I was only too glad to accept their invitation.
As it happens, I also rather liked this Cosi at the Capitole de Toulouse, directed by Monsieur Nicolas Joel, with whom I also had luncheon on Friday.</description>

      <description>It is now sixteen or seventeen years since I saw the Queen of France, then the Dauphiness, at Versailles; and surely never lighted on this orb, which she hardly seemed to touch, a more delightful vision. I saw her just above the horizon, decorating and cheering the elevated sphere she had just begun to move in, –glittering like the morning star full of life and splendor and joy. Oh! what a revolution!</description>

      <description>I have thought, and thought again, about whether I should write about this. Does civilisation still mean anything — when something so abominable can happen in the heart one of the world’s oldest and greatest civilisations?
I have just read in Le Monde, here at Saint-Tropez, that several organisations have demonstrated to protest against the public hanging of two Iranian teenagers, who had been convicted of sodomy and rape, at Mashad in Iran.</description>

      <description>La Virginité, comme toutes les monstruosités, a des richesses spéciales, des grandeurs absorbantes. La vie, dont les forces sont économisées, a pris chez l’individu vierge une qualité de résistance et de durée incalculable. Le cerveau s’est enrichi de l’ensemble de ses facultés réservées. Lorsque les gens chastes ont besoin de leur corps ou de leur âme, qu’ils recourent à l’action ou à la pensée, ils trouvent alors de l’acier dans leurs muscles ou de la science infuse dans leur intelligence, une force diabolique ou la magie noire de la Volonté§.</description>

      <description>I’ve decided to keep a blog.
I’ve always enjoyed writing down my thoughts, but before the Internet, this took the form of a diary I kept at school, which I’ve sporadically updated, with very long interruptions, ever since. But this was really for my own personal use, as I find it useful to compare my feelings about events at the time of their occurrence with my later vision as shaped by the benefit of hindsight.</description>
