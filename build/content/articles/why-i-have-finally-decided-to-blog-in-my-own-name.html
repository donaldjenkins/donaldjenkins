<p>When I started blogging, in 2005 on a Saint-Tropez beach, I decided not to use my own name. I used an amusing pseudonym. I don’t believe this choice has any way hampered my style. But with the change in my life, interests and job that <a href="https://www.donaldjenkins.com/back/" title="Back…">occurred last year</a>, and also the decision to switch to English after three years of blogging in French, the time has come to draw the process to a logical conclusion and make this domain, donaldjenkins.com, my only home on the web. I’ve taken advantage of the move to improve the site design and simplify its structure: it basically now consists of just blog posts and a short <a href="https://www.donaldjenkins.com/about/">About</a> page.</p>

<p>Keeping one’s web presence to a reasonable number of sites is essential to avoid dispersion. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/astorg/" title="Flickr: Galerie de astorg">Flickr</a> for photos, <a href="http://twitter.com/donaldjenkins" title="Twitter / donaldjenkins">Twitter</a> for ramblings, and <a href="http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=706186626" title="Facebook">Facebook</a> for friends (please don’t add me unless I actually know you in real life) are the only ones you need to keep your friends in touch.</p>

<p>The one useful addition you might want to consider of top of those three basics is <a href="http://www.google.com/reader/shared/08163851508448927619" title="Google Reader - astorg's shared items">Google Reader</a>: it’s an amazingly easy medium for those who like keeping tabs on web posts I have found interesting enough to bookmark. Anything else will basically be relegated to a link on the <a href="https://www.donaldjenkins.com/about/">About</a> page.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ectomorphicvicissitudes?format=xml" title="Donald Jenkins">RSS feed link</a> remains unchanged and all the other links should redirect smoothly I hope. And I’ll be inaugurating the new site, from Oxford where I’ll be departing tomorrow, with a nice blog post about the fiftieth anniversary — or rather lack of it — of the French Culture Ministry.</p>
