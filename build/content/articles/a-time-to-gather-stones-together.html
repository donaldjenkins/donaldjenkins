<blockquote>
<p>To every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven:</p>

<p>A time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to pluck up that which is planted;</p>

<p>A time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to break down, and a time to build up;</p>

<p>A time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance;</p>

<p>A time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones together; a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing;</p>

<p>A time to get, and a time to lose; a time to keep, and a time to cast away;</p>

<p>A time to rend, and a time to sew; a time to keep silence, and a time to speak;</p>

<p>A time to love, and a time to hate; a time of war, and a time of peace.</p>
