<p>I’ve decided to keep a blog.</p>

<p>I’ve always enjoyed writing down my thoughts, but before the Internet, this took the form of a diary I kept at school, which I’ve sporadically updated, with very long interruptions, ever since. But this was really for my own personal use, as I find it useful to compare my feelings about events at the time of their occurrence with my later vision as shaped by the benefit of hindsight. I was occasionally asked to contribute articles for publications, although this not something I’ve so far pursued with any zeal.</p>

<p>But a blog, available for anyone to read, easy to update, that can stay online for ever if I so choose… I think I’ll enjoy that and I hope it won’t be a passing fad, although I know I’ll probably post irregularly. In the past year or so, my life has changed pretty radically: I’m engaged in a challenging job that I’m passionate about. And there’s been change on the personal front as well. I won’t necessarily have masses of time for this, but the motivation is there.</p>

<p>And I’m also curious to get to grips with the technical aspects. The Internet, for me, has been the realisation of a childhood dream: making every possible bit of information accessible worldwide. I’m keen that this should not be just a one-way process, and to make my own modest contribution to the system. I hope I’ll be up to the challenge.</p>
